H/A
Create a regular object and make it iterable. In this case, the iteration should proceed as follows:
All values from the object's from property to the to property must be traversed one by one. (if to < from - an error should occur).
If to or from is not specified OR to or from are not numbers, an error should occur.

> Examples:
> const myIterable = { from: 1, to: 4 };
> for (let item of myIterable) {
> console.log(item); // 1, 2, 3, 4
> }

const myIterable = { from: 'aaa', to: 4 };
for (let item of myIterable) { // Error!
console.log(item);
}

H/A
You need to implement a function that will take a person's name and age as arguments and then return an array of objects. Each object must be created in a unique way.
Additionally - it is not necessary to write these properties as your own for the object, you can play with prototypes

/// Example
function getPersons(name, age) {
return [
{
name,
age,
},
Object.assign({}, { name, age }),
];
}
